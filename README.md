# Software Quality Engineer Job Scraper

A script to automatically search Glassdoor for job listings, aggregate every application URL, and consolidate the data into a file.

## Installation


## Usage
#### To test `get_links.py`
1. Uncomment the last line `get_links.py`
2. Run `$ python get_links.py`

#### To run the entire script:
1. Set a number of pages you'd like to iterate through here
2. Run `$ python apply.py`
3. The script will open [glassdoor.com](https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm), at which point you should log-in
4. From there on, everything is automatic!
